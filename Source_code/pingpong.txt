This game is inspired by pingpong (also known as table tennis).
With simple rules and minimalist controls, the game is really accessible for all audiences..


                              2. Instructions for using the setting menu
In the settings, there are 2 items: "Language" and "Switch keyboard".
The "Language" section helps players switch between English-Vietnamese.
The "Switch keyboard" section allows players to reset the movement keys to their liking.

                                    3. Game Instructions
-Control:
Use the default keys or the keys you have reset to move your bar.
Player 1 press w to go up, press s to down.
Player 2 press i to go up, press k to go down.

-Rule:
Initially the ball will be in the center of the field, and the two bars will be between the sides.
When one side starts to move the bar, the ball will randomly move left or right.
The player uses his stick to prevent the ball from going over his boundary.
Each time the ball crosses the boundary of one side, the other side will receive a point.
There are 2 important milestones to determine the winner and loser:
+When a player reaches 4 points, the next round will be the decisive round (match points).
If they score 1 more point then the game will be over and they will be the winner.
+ In case both get 4 points, we will enter the extra round (overtime).
Here the player needs to get 2 consecutive points to win.
